# FreeStore Project - Back-end

## What is it?
That's the second fullstack project created in the Driven Education web development bootcamp.
It's an e-commerce app that sort of clones the famous Mercado Livre from Latin America; hence,
it allows you to sell and buy basically whatever you want.

## Technologies involved
- ReactJS
- Axios
- ContextAPI
- Styled Components
- DayJS
- And plenty more!
